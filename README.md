# **AI-Powered Smart Educational Translation System for Indian Languages**  
### **Team: Translate Titans**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to break language barriers in education using an **AI-powered Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model**. By leveraging **deep learning, NLP, and machine translation techniques**, we provide **fast, accurate, and reliable translations** for Indian languages.  

### **Why This Project?**  
- **Language Barriers**: Most educational content is available in English, making it inaccessible for regional language speakers.  
- **Manual Translation Is Slow**: Human translation is **time-consuming and resource-intensive**.  
- **AI Can Help**: An AI-driven translation model can **speed up knowledge dissemination** and **enhance educational accessibility**.  

---

## **Project Steps**  

1. **Dataset Collection**  
   - Using **AI4Bharat Samanantar** and **IndicTrans2** for high-quality translations.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Text Cleaning, Tokenization, and STEM filtering for optimized model performance.  

3. **Model Development & Training**  
   - Implementing a **Transformer-based NMT model** (IndicTrans2).  
   - Fine-tuning using **BLEU Score and Accuracy Metrics**.  

4. **Deployment**  
   - Backend using **Flask API**.  
   - Frontend using **Streamlit Web App**.  
   - Database with **MongoDB/PostgreSQL**.  

5. **User Feedback Integration**  
   - Continuously improving translations based on user inputs.

## **Setup Environment**  
### **Requirements**  
Ensure you have the following installed:  

- Python 3.8+  
- TensorFlow/PyTorch  
- Flask  
- Streamlit  
- MongoDB/PostgreSQL  

### **Install the Requirements**  
Run the following command:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

---

## **Setup Dataset**  
The project uses **AI4Bharat Samanantar & IndicTrans2 datasets**.  

1. **Download the datasets**:  
   - Visit [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in) to access data.  
2. **Preprocess the data**:  
   - Run the preprocessing script:  
     ```bash
     python preprocess_data.py
     ```  

---

## **Explore the Data**  
To get an overview of the dataset, run:  
```bash
python explore_data.py
```  

---

## **Data Preprocessing**  
Preprocessing steps include:  
- **Text Cleaning**: Removing unnecessary symbols and characters.  
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into meaningful words.  
- **STEM Filtering**: Keeping only root words to improve translation accuracy.  

Run the preprocessing script:  
```bash
python preprocess_data.py
```  

---

## **Getting Started**  
To start the web app, use:  
```bash
python app.py
```  
Then open `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser.
